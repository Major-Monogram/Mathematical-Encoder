Description:
This application provides a simple and secure way to encode text messages using a 4-digit PIN. The encoded message can then be decoded only with the correct PIN. If an incorrect PIN is used, instead of the real message a random string of letters will be generated.

Features
- Secure encoding with a 4-digit PIN
- Decoding with correct PIN reveals original message

Prerequisites: None
Instructions: Just download the application and run. (no installation required)

Usage
Encoding:
1. Enter the text message you want to encode.
2. Create a strong 4-digit PIN (important for security).
3. Use the application to encode the message with the chosen PIN.
4. The encoded message will be displayed.
Decoding:
1. Input the encoded message.
2. Enter the correct 4-digit PIN used for encoding.
3. The application will decode the message, revealing the original text.
4. If an incorrect PIN is used, a random string of letters will be generated instead.
